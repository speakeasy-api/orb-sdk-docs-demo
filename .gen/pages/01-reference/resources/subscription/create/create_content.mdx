###### *Subscription*

## Create

A subscription represents the purchase of a plan by a customer. The customer is identified by either the `customer_id`
or the `external_customer_id`, and exactly one of these fields must be provided.

By default, subscriptions begin on the day that they're created and renew automatically for each billing cycle at the
cadence that's configured in the plan definition.

The default configuration for subscriptions in Orb is **In-advance billing** and **Beginning of month alignment** (see
[Subscription](../guides/concepts#subscription) for more details).

In order to change the alignment behavior, Orb also supports billing subscriptions on the day of the month they are
created. If `align_billing_with_subscription_start_date = true` is specified, subscriptions have billing cycles that are
aligned with their `start_date`. For example, a subscription that begins on January 15th will have a billing cycle from
January 15th to February 15th. Every subsequent billing cycle will continue to start and invoice on the 15th.

If the "day" value is greater than the number of days in the month, the next billing cycle will start at the end of the
month. For example, if the start_date is January 31st, the next billing cycle will start on February 28th.

If a customer was created with a currency, Orb only allows subscribing the customer to a plan with a matching
`invoicing_currency`. If the customer does not have a currency set, on subscription creation, we set the customer's
currency to be the `invoicing_currency` of the plan.

## Price overrides

Price overrides are used to update some or all prices in a plan for the specific subscription being created. This is
useful when a new customer has negotiated one or more different prices for a specific plan than the plan's default
prices. Any type of price can be overridden, if the correct data is provided. The billable metric, cadence, type, and
name of a price can not be overridden.


To override prices, provide a list of objects with the key `price_overrides`. The price object in the list of overrides
is expected to contain the existing price id, the `model_type` and config value in the format below. The specific
numerical values can be updated, but the config value and `model_type` must match the existing price that is being
overridden

### Request format for price overrides

Orb supports a few different pricing models out of the box. The `model_type` field determines the key for the
configuration object that is present.

### Unit pricing

With unit pricing, each unit costs a fixed amount.

```json
{
...
"id": "price_id",
"model_type": "unit",
"unit_config": {
"unit_amount": "0.50"
}
...
}
```

### Tiered pricing

In tiered pricing, the cost of a given unit depends on the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is
defined by an upper and lower bound. For example, the first ten units may cost $0.50 each and all units thereafter may
cost $0.10 each. Tiered prices can be overridden with a new number of tiers or new values for `first_unit`, `last_unit`,
or `unit_amount`.

```json
{
...
"id": "price_id",
"model_type": "tiered",
"tiered_config": {
"tiers": [
{
"first_unit":"1",
"last_unit": "10",
"unit_amount": "0.50"
},
{
"first_unit": "10",
"last_unit": null,
"unit_amount": "0.10"
}
]
}
...
}
```

### Bulk pricing

Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of _all_ units. For example, if you've bought less than
10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40). Bulk prices can be overridden with a new number of tiers or new
values for `maximum_units`, or `unit_amount`.

```json
{
...
"id": "price_id",
"model_type": "bulk",
"bulk_config": {
"tiers": [
{
"maximum_units": "10",
"unit_amount": "0.50"
},
{
"maximum_units": "1000",
"unit_amount": "0.40"
}
]
}
...
}
```
### Package pricing

Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes. For example, if the package size is set
to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5 and 6 units will be billed at 10.

```json
{
...
"id": "price_id",
"model_type": "package",
"package_config": {
"package_amount": "0.80",
"package_size": 10
}
...
}
```
### BPS pricing

BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a percent (the number of basis points to
charge), as well as a cap per event to assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.

```json
{
...
"id": "price_id"
"model_type": "bps",
"bps_config": {
"bps": 125,
"per_event_cap": "11.00"
}
...
}
```
### Bulk BPS pricing

Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the total quantity across all events. Similar
to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment volume is reached, each
individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller take-rate.

```json
{
...
"id": "price_id"
"model_type": "bulk_bps",
"bulk_bps_config": {
"tiers": [
{
"minimum_amount": "0.00",
"maximum_amount": "1000000.00",
"bps": 125,
"per_event_cap": "19.00"
},
{
"minimum_amount":"1000000.00",
"maximum_amount": null,
"bps": 115,
"per_event_cap": "4.00"
}
]
}
...
}
```
### Tiered BPS pricing
Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an event's applicable parameter is a function
of its marginal addition to the period total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For example, the first
few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS
each.

```json
{
...
"id": "price_id"
"model_type": "tiered_bps",
"tiered_bps_config": {
"tiers": [
{
"minimum_amount": "0.00",
"maximum_amount": "1000000.00",
"bps": 125,
"per_event_cap": "19.00"
},
{
"minimum_amount":"1000000",
"maximum_amount": null,
"bps": 115,
"per_event_cap": "4.00"
}
]
}
...
}
```
### Matrix pricing
Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix. `dimensions` defines the two event
property values evaluated in this pricing model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for specified property values. In a
one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an
event does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the `default_unit_amount`.
```json
...
"model_type": "matrix"
"matrix_config": {
"default_unit_amount": "3.00",
"dimensions": [
"cluster_name",
"region"
],
"matrix_values": [
{
"dimension_values": [
"alpha",
"west"
],
"unit_amount": "2.00"
},
...
]
}
...
```

### Fixed fees
Fixed fees follow unit pricing, and also have an additional parameter `fixed_price_quantity` that indicates how many of
a fixed fee that should be applied for a subscription. This parameter defaults to 1.

```json
{
...
"id": "price_id",
"model_type": "unit",
"unit_config": {
"unit_amount": "2.00"
},
"fixed_price_quantity": 3.0
...
}
```

## Maximums and Minimums
Minimums and maximums, much like price overrides, can be useful when a new customer has negotiated a new or different
minimum or maximum spend cap than the default for a given price. If one exists for a price
and null is provided for the minimum/maximum override on creation, then there
will be no minimum/maximum on the new subscription. If no value is provided, then the default price maximum or minimum is
used.

To add a minimum for a specific price, add `minimum_amount` to the specific price in the `price_overrides` object.

To add a maximum for a specific price, add `maximum_amount` to the specific price in the `price_overrides` object.


### Minimum override example

Price minimum override example:

```json
{
...
"id": "price_id",
"model_type": "unit",
"unit_config": {
"unit_amount": "0.50"
},
"minimum_amount": "100.00"
...
}
```


Removing an existing minimum example
```json
{
...
"id": "price_id",
"model_type": "unit",
"unit_config": {
"unit_amount": "0.50"
},
"minimum_amount": null
...
}
```

## Discounts
Discounts, like price overrides, can be useful when a new customer has negotiated a new or different discount than the
default for a price. A single price price can have at most
one discount. If a discount exists for a price and a null discount is provided on creation, then there will be
no discount on the new subscription.

To add a discount for a specific price, add `discount` to the price in the `price_overrides` object.
Discount should be a dictionary of the format:
```json
{
"discount_type": "amount" | "percentage" | "usage",
"amount_discount": string,
"percentage_discount": string,
"usage_discount": string
}
```
where either `amount_discount`, `percentage_discount`, or `usage_discount` is provided.

Price discount example
```json
{
...
"id": "price_id",
"model_type": "unit",
"unit_config": {
"unit_amount": "0.50"
},
"discount": {"discount_type": "amount", "amount_discount": "175"},
}
```

Removing an existing discount example
```json
{
"customer_id": "customer_id",
"plan_id": "plan_id",
"discount": null,
"price_overrides": [ ... ]
...
}
```

## Threshold Billing

Orb supports invoicing for a subscription when a preconfigured usage threshold is hit. To enable threshold billing, pass
in an `invoicing_threshold`, which is specified in the subscription's invoicing currency, when creating a subscription.
Ex. pass in `10.00` to issue an invoice when usage amounts hit $10.00 for a subscription that invoices in USD.
