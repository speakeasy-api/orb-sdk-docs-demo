## Add Edit Price Intervals

This endpoint is used to add and edit subscription [price intervals](../reference/price-interval). By making
modifications to a subscription’s price intervals, you can [flexibly and atomically control the billing behavior of a
subscription](../guides/product-catalog/modifying-subscriptions).

## Adding price intervals

Prices can be added as
price intervals to a subscription by specifying them in the `add` array. A `price_id` or `external_price_id` from an
add-on price or previously removed plan price can be specified to reuse an existing price definition (however, please
note that prices from other plans cannot be added to the subscription). Additionally, a new price can be specified using
the `price` field — this price will be created automatically.

A `start_date` must be specified for the price
interval. This is the date when the price will start billing on the subscription, so this will notably result in an
immediate charge at this time for any billed in advance fixed fees. The `end_date` will default to null, resulting in a
price interval that will bill on a continually recurring basis. Both of these dates can be set in the past or the future
and Orb will generate or modify invoices to ensure the subscription’s invoicing behavior is correct.

Additionally, a
discount, minimum, or maximum can be specified on the price interval. This will only apply to this price interval, not
any other price intervals on the subscription.

## Editing price intervals

Price intervals can be adjusted by
specifying edits to make in the `edit` array. A `price_interval_id` to edit must be specified — this can be retrieved
from the `price_intervals` field on the subscription.

A new `start_date` or `end_date` can be specified to change the
range of the price interval, which will modify past or future invoices to ensure correctness. If either of these dates
are unspecified, they will default to the existing date on the price interval. To remove a price interval entirely from
a subscription, set the `end_date` to be equivalent to the `start_date`.

## Fixed fee quantity transitions
The fixed fee quantity transitions for a fixed fee price interval can also be specified when adding or editing by passing an
array for `fixed_fee_quantity_transitions`. A fixed fee quantity transition must have a `quantity` and an
`effective_date`, which is the date after which the new quantity will be used for billing. If a fixed fee quantity
transition is scheduled at a billing period boundary, the full quantity will be billed on an invoice with the other
prices on the subscription. If the fixed fee quantity transition is scheduled mid-billing period, the difference between
the existing quantity and quantity specified in the transition will be prorated for the rest of the billing period and
billed immediately, which will generate a new invoice.

Notably, the list of fixed fee quantity transitions passed
will overwrite the existing fixed fee quantity transitions on the price interval, so the entire list of transitions must
be specified to add additional transitions. The existing list of transitions can be retrieved using the
`fixed_fee_quantity_transitions` property on a subscription’s serialized price intervals.
