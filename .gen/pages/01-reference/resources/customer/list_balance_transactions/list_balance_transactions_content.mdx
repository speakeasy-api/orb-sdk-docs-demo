## List Balance Transactions

## The customer balance

The customer balance is an amount in the customer's currency, which Orb automatically applies to subsequent
invoices. This balance can be adjusted manually via Orb's webapp on the customer details page. You can use this
balance to provide a fixed mid-period credit to the customer. Commonly, this is done due to system downtime/SLA
violation, or an adhoc adjustment discussed with the customer.

If the balance is a positive value at the time of invoicing, it represents that the customer has credit that should
be used to offset the amount due on the next issued invoice. In this case, Orb will automatically reduce the next
invoice by the balance amount, and roll over any remaining balance if the invoice is fully discounted.

If the balance is a negative value at the time of invoicing, Orb will increase the invoice's amount due with a
positive adjustment, and reset the balance to 0.

This endpoint retrieves all customer balance transactions in reverse chronological order for a single customer,
providing a complete audit trail of all adjustments and invoice applications.

## Eligibility

The customer balance can only be applied to invoices or adjusted manually if invoices are not synced to a separate
invoicing provider. If a payment gateway such as Stripe is used, the balance will be applied to the invoice before
forwarding payment to the gateway.
