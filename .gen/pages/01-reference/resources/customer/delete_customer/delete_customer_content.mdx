## Delete Customer

This performs a deletion of this customer, its subscriptions, and its invoices.
This operation is irreversible. Note that this is a _soft_ deletion, but the data
will be inaccessible through the API and Orb dashboard. For hard-deletion, please
reach out to the Orb team directly.

**Note**: This operation happens asynchronously and can be expected to take a
few minutes to propagate to related resources. However, querying for the customer on
subsequent GET requests while deletion is in process will reflect its deletion with
a `deleted: true` property. Once the customer deletion has been fully processed,
the customer will not be returned in the API.


On successful processing, this returns an empty dictionary (`{}`) in the API.
