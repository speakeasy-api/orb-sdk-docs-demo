## Create

Creating the backfill enables adding or replacing past events, even those that are older than the ingestion grace
period. Performing a backfill in Orb involves 3 steps:

1. Create the backfill, specifying its parameters.
2. [Ingest](ingest) usage events, referencing the backfill (query parameter `backfill_id`).
3. [Close](close-backfill) the
backfill, propagating the update in past usage throughout Orb.

Changes from a backfill are not reflected until the
backfill is closed, so you won’t need to worry about your customers seeing partially updated usage data. Backfills are
also reversible, so you’ll be able to revert a backfill if you’ve made a mistake.

This endpoint will return a
backfill object, which contains an `id`. That `id` can then be used as the `backfill_id` query parameter to the event
ingestion endpoint to associate ingested events with this backfill. The effects (e.g. updated usage graphs) of this
backfill will not take place until the backfill is closed.

If the `replace_existing_events` is `true`, existing
events in the backfill's timeframe will be replaced with the newly ingested events associated with the backfill. If
`false`, newly ingested events will be added to the existing events.
