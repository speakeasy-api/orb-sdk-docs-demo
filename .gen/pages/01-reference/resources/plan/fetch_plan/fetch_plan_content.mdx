## Fetch Plan

This endpoint is used to fetch [plan](../guides/concepts##plan-and-price) details given a plan identifier.
It returns information about the prices included in the plan and their configuration, as well as the product
that the plan is attached to.

## Serialized prices
Orb supports a few different pricing models out of the box.
Each of these models is serialized differently in a given [Price](../guides/concepts#plan-and-price) object.
The `model_type` field determines the key for the configuration object that is present. A detailed explanation of
price types can be found in the [Price schema](../guides/concepts#plan-and-price).

## Phases
Orb supports plan phases, also known as contract ramps. For plans with phases, the serialized prices refer to
all prices across all phases.
