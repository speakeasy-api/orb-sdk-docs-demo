## Fetch Plan External Id

This endpoint is used to fetch [plan](../guides/concepts##plan-and-price) details given an external_plan_id
identifier. It returns information about the prices included in the plan and their configuration, as well as
the product that the plan is attached to.

## Serialized prices
Orb supports a few different pricing models
out of the box. Each of these models is serialized differently in a given [Price](../guides/concepts#plan-and-price)
object. The `model_type` field determines the key for the configuration object that is present. A detailed explanation
of price types can be found in the [Price schema](../guides/concepts#plan-and-price). "
