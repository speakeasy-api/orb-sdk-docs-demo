##### `enabled` *{`Optional[bool]`}*
True only if auto\-collection is enabled for this invoice.

---
##### `next_attempt_at` [*{ `date` }*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#date-objects)
If the invoice is scheduled for auto\-collection, this field will reflect when the next attempt will occur. If dunning has been exhausted, or auto\-collection is not enabled for this invoice, this field will be `null`.

---
##### `previously_attempted_at` [*{ `date` }*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#date-objects)
If Orb has ever attempted payment auto\-collection for this invoice, this field will reflect when that attempt occurred. In conjunction with `next_attempt_at`, this can be used to tell whether the invoice is currently in dunning (that is, `previously_attempted_at` is non\-null, and `next_attempt_time` is non\-null), or if dunning has been exhausted (`previously_attempted_at` is non\-null, but `next_attempt_time` is null).
