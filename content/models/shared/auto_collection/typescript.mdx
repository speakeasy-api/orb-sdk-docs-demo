##### `enabled`: *{`boolean`}*
True only if auto\-collection is enabled for this invoice.

##### `nextAttemptAt`: [*{ `Date` }*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
If the invoice is scheduled for auto\-collection, this field will reflect when the next attempt will occur. If dunning has been exhausted, or auto\-collection is not enabled for this invoice, this field will be `null`.

##### `previouslyAttemptedAt`: [*{ `Date` }*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
If Orb has ever attempted payment auto\-collection for this invoice, this field will reflect when that attempt occurred. In conjunction with `next_attempt_at`, this can be used to tell whether the invoice is currently in dunning (that is, `previously_attempted_at` is non\-null, and `next_attempt_time` is non\-null), or if dunning has been exhausted (`previously_attempted_at` is non\-null, but `next_attempt_time` is null).
