##### `billingCycleDay`: *{`number`}*
The day of the month on which the billing cycle is anchored. If the maximum number of days in a month is greater than this value, the last day of the month is the billing cycle day (e.g. billing_cycle_day=31 for April means the billing period begins on the 30th.

##### `currentBillingPeriodEndDate`: [*{ `Date` }*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)

##### `currentBillingPeriodStartDate`: [*{ `Date` }*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)

---
##### `customer`: *{`Customer`}*
A customer is a buyer of your products, and the other party to the billing relationship.

In Orb, customers are assigned system generated identifiers automatically, but it's often desirable to have these
match existing identifiers in your system. To avoid having to denormalize Orb ID information, you can pass in an
`external_customer_id` with your own identifier. See
[Customer ID Aliases](../guides/events-and-metrics/customer-aliases) for further information about how these
aliases work in Orb.

In addition to having an identifier in your system, a customer may exist in a payment provider solution like
Stripe. Use the `payment_provider_id` and the `payment_provider` enum field to express this mapping.

A customer also has a timezone (from the standard [IANA timezone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones)), which
defaults to your account's timezone. See [Timezone localization](../guides/product-catalog/timezones.md) for
information on what this timezone parameter influences within Orb.
