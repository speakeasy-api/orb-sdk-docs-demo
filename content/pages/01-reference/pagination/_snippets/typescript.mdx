## Pagination

Some of the endpoints in this SDK support pagination. To use pagination, you make your SDK calls as usual, but the
returned response object will have a `next` method that can be called to pull down the next group of results. If the
return value of `next` is `null`, then there are no more pages to be fetched.

Here's an example of one such pagination call:


## [object Object]

```typescript
import { Orb } from "orb-billing";
import { ListCouponsRequest } from "orb-billing/dist/sdk/models/operations";

(async () => {
    const sdk = new Orb({
        security: {
            apiKeyAuth: "",
        },
    });
    const cursor: string = "string";
    const limit: number = 768578;
    const redemptionCode: string = "string";
    const showArchived: boolean = false;

    const res = await sdk.coupon.list(cursor, limit, redemptionCode, showArchived);

    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        do {
            // handle items

            res = res.next();
        } while (res);
    }
})();

```
