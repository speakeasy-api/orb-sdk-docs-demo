## Search

This endpoint returns a filtered set of events for an account in a [paginated list format](../reference/pagination).

Note that this is a `POST` endpoint rather than a `GET` endpoint because it employs a JSON body for search criteria
rather than query parameters, allowing for a more flexible search syntax.

Note that a search criteria _must_ be specified. Currently, Orb supports the following criteria:
- `event_ids`: This is an explicit array of IDs to filter by. Note that an event's ID is the `idempotency_key` that
  was originally used for ingestion.
- `invoice_id`: This is an issued Orb invoice ID (see also [List Invoices](list-invoices)). Orb will fetch all
  events that were used to calculate the invoice. In the common case, this will be a list of events whose
  `timestamp` property falls within the billing period specified by the invoice.

By default, Orb does not return _deprecated_ events in this endpoint.

By default, Orb will not throw a `404` if no events matched, Orb will return an empty array for `data` instead.
