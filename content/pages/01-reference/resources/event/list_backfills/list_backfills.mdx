## List Backfills

This endpoint returns a list of all backfills in a list format.

The list of backfills is ordered starting from the most recently created backfill. The response also includes
[`pagination_metadata`](../reference/pagination), which lets the caller retrieve the next page of results if they
exist. More information about pagination can be found in the [Pagination-metadata schema](pagination).
