###### *Customer*

## Create

This operation is used to create an Orb customer, who is party to the core billing relationship. See
[Customer](../guides/concepts#customer) for an overview of the customer resource.

This endpoint is critical in the following Orb functionality:
* Automated charges can be configured by setting `payment_provider` and `payment_provider_id` to automatically
  issue invoices
* [Customer ID Aliases](../guides/events-and-metrics/customer-aliases) can be configured by setting
  `external_customer_id`
* [Timezone localization](../guides/product-catalog/timezones.md) can be configured on a per-customer basis by
  setting the `timezone` parameter
