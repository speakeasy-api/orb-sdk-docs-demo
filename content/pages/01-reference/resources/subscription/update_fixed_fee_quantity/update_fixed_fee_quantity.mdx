###### *Subscription*

## Update Fixed Fee Quantity

This endpoint can be used to update the quantity for a fixed fee.

To be eligible, the subscription must currently be active and the price specified must be a fixed fee (not
usage-based). This operation will immediately update the quantity for the fee, or if a `effective_date` is passed
in, will update the quantity on the requested date at midnight in the customer's timezone.

In order to change the fixed fee quantity as of the next draft invoice for this subscription, pass
`change_option=upcoming_invoice` without an `effective_date` specified.

If the fee is an in-advance fixed fee, it will also issue an immediate invoice for the difference for the remainder
of the billing period.
