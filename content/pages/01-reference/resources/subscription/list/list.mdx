## List

This endpoint returns a list of all subscriptions for an account as a [paginated](../reference/pagination) list,
ordered starting from the most recently created subscription. For a full discussion of the subscription resource,
see [Subscription](../guides/concepts#subscription).

Subscriptions can be filtered to a single customer by
passing in the `customer_id` query parameter or the `external_customer_id` query parameter.
