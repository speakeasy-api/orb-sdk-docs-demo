## Fetch Usage

This endpoint is used to fetch a subscription's usage in Orb. Especially when combined with optional query
parameters, this endpoint is a powerful way to build visualizations on top of Orb's event data and metrics.

With no query parameters specified, this endpoint returns usage for the subscription's _current billing period_
across each billable metric that participates in the subscription. Usage quantities returned are the result of
evaluating the metric definition for the entirety of the customer's billing period.

### Default response shape
Orb returns a `data` array with an object corresponding to each billable metric. Nested within this object is a
`usage` array which has a `quantity` value and a corresponding `timeframe_start` and `timeframe_end`.  The `quantity`
value represents the calculated usage value for the billable metric over the specified timeframe (inclusive of the
`timeframe_start` timestamp and exclusive of the `timeframe_end` timestamp).

Orb will include _every_ window in the response starting from the beginning of the billing period, even when there
were no events (and therefore no usage) in the window. This increases the size of the response but prevents the caller
from filling in gaps and handling cumbersome time-based logic.

The query parameters in this endpoint serve to override this behavior and provide some key functionality, as listed
below. Note that this functionality can also be used _in conjunction_ with each other, e.g. to display grouped usage
on a custom timeframe.

## Custom timeframe
In order to view usage for a custom timeframe rather than the current billing period, specify a `timeframe_start` and
`timeframe_end`. This will calculate quantities for usage incurred between timeframe_start (inclusive) and timeframe_end
(exclusive), i.e. `[timeframe_start, timeframe_end)`.

Note:
- These timestamps must be specified in ISO 8601 format and UTC timezone, e.g. `2022-02-01T05:00:00Z`.
- Both parameters must be specified if either is specified.

## Grouping by custom attributes
In order to view a single metric grouped by a specific _attribute_ that each event is tagged with (e.g. `cluster`), you
must additionally specify a `billable_metric_id` and a `group_by` key. The `group_by` key denotes the event property on
which to group.

When returning grouped usage, only usage for `billable_metric_id` is  returned, and a separate object in the `data` array
is returned for each value of the `group_by` key present in your events. The `quantity` value is the result of evaluating
the billable metric for events filtered to a single value of the `group_by` key.

Orb expects that events that match the billable metric will contain values in the `properties` dictionary that correspond
to the `group_by` key specified. By default, Orb will not return a `null` group (i.e. events that match the metric but
do not have the key set). Currently, it is only possible to view usage grouped by a single attribute at a time.

 When viewing grouped usage, Orb uses pagination to limit the response size to 1000 groups by default. If there are more
 groups for a given subscription, pagination metadata in the response can be used to fetch all of the data.

The following example shows usage for an "API Requests" billable metric grouped by `region`. Note the extra `metric_group`
dictionary in the response, which provides metadata about the group:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "usage": [
                {
                    "quantity": 0.19291,
                    "timeframe_start": "2021-10-01T07:00:00Z",
                    "timeframe_end": "2021-10-02T07:00:00Z",
                },
                ...
            ],
            "metric_group": {
                "property_key": "region",
                "property_value": "asia/pacific"
            },
            "billable_metric": {
                "id": "Fe9pbpMk86xpwdGB",
                "name": "API Requests"
            },
            "view_mode": "periodic"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```


## Windowed usage
The `granularity` parameter can be used to _window_ the usage `quantity` value into periods. When not specified, usage
is returned for the entirety of the time range.

When `granularity = day` is specified with a timeframe longer than a day, Orb will return a `quantity` value for each
full day between `timeframe_start` and `timeframe_end`. Note that the days are demarcated by the _customer's local midnight_.

For example, with `timeframe_start = 2022-02-01T05:00:00Z`, `timeframe_end = 2022-02-04T01:00:00Z` and `granularity=day`,
the following windows will be returned for a customer in the `America/Los_Angeles` timezone since local midnight is `08:00` UTC:
- `[2022-02-01T05:00:00Z, 2022-02-01T08:00:00Z)`
- `[2022-02-01T08:00:00, 2022-02-02T08:00:00Z)`
- `[2022-02-02T08:00:00, 2022-02-03T08:00:00Z)`
- `[2022-02-03T08:00:00, 2022-02-04T01:00:00Z)`

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "billable_metric": {
                "id": "Q8w89wjTtBdejXKsm",
                "name": "API Requests"
            },
            "usage": [
                {
                    "quantity": 0,
                    "timeframe_end": "2022-02-01T08:00:00+00:00",
                    "timeframe_start": "2022-02-01T05:00:00+00:00"
                },
                {

                    "quantity": 0,
                    "timeframe_end": "2022-02-02T08:00:00+00:00",
                    "timeframe_start": "2022-02-01T08:00:00+00:00"
                },
                {
                    "quantity": 0,
                    "timeframe_end": "2022-02-03T08:00:00+00:00",
                    "timeframe_start": "2022-02-02T08:00:00+00:00"
                },
                {
                    "quantity": 0,
                    "timeframe_end": "2022-02-04T01:00:00+00:00",
                    "timeframe_start": "2022-02-03T08:00:00+00:00"
                }
            ],
            "view_mode": "periodic"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Decomposable vs. non-decomposable metrics
Billable metrics fall into one of two categories: decomposable and non-decomposable. A decomposable billable metric, such as
a sum or a count, can be displayed and aggregated across arbitrary timescales. On the other hand, a non-decomposable metric
is not meaningful when only a slice of the billing window is considered.

As an example, if we have a billable metric that's defined to count unique users, displaying a graph of unique users for each
day is not representative of the billable metric value over the month (days could have an overlapping set of 'unique' users).
Instead, what's useful for any given day is the number of unique users in the billing period so far, which are the
_cumulative_ unique users.

Accordingly, this endpoint returns treats these two types of metrics differently when `group_by` is specified:
- Decomposable metrics can be grouped by any event property.
- Non-decomposable metrics can only be grouped by the corresponding price's invoice grouping key. If no invoice grouping key
is present, the metric does not support `group_by`.

## Matrix prices
When a billable metric is attached to a price that uses matrix pricing, it's important to view usage grouped by those matrix
dimensions. In this case, use the query parameters `first_dimension_key`, `first_dimension_value` and `second_dimension_key`,
`second_dimension_value` while filtering to a specific `billable_metric_id`.

For example, if your compute metric has a separate unit price (i.e. a matrix pricing model) per `region` and `provider`,
your request might provide the following parameters:

- `first_dimension_key`: `region`
- `first_dimension_value`: `us-east-1`
- `second_dimension_key`: `provider`
- `second_dimension_value`: `aws`
