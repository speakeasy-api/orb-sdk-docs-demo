## Schedule Plan Change

This endpoint can be used to change the plan on an existing subscription. It returns the serialized updated
subscription object.

The body parameter `change_option` determines the timing of the plan change. Orb supports three options:
- `end_of_subscription_term`: changes the plan at the end of the existing plan's term.
    - Issuing this plan change request for a monthly subscription will keep the existing plan active until the start
      of the subsequent month, and potentially issue an invoice for any usage charges incurred in the intervening
      period.
    - Issuing this plan change request for a yearly subscription will keep the existing plan active for the full
      year.
- `immediate`: changes the plan immediately. Subscriptions that have their plan changed with this option will be
  invoiced immediately. This invoice will include any usage fees incurred in the billing period up to the change,
  along with any prorated recurring fees for the billing period, if applicable.
- `requested_date`: changes the plan on the requested date (`change_date`). If no timezone is provided, the
  customer's timezone is used. The `change_date` body parameter is required if this option is chosen.

Note that one of `plan_id` or `external_plan_id` is required in the request body for this operation.

## Price overrides, maximums, and minimums
Price overrides are used to update some or all prices in the target plan. Minimums and maximums, much like price
overrides, can be useful when a new customer has negotiated a new or different minimum or maximum spend cap than the
default for the plan. The request format for price overrides, maximums, and minimums are the same as those in
[subscription creation](create-subscription).

## Prorations for in-advance fees
By default, Orb calculates the prorated difference in any fixed fees when making a plan change, adjusting the
customer balance as needed. For details on this behavior, see
[Modifying subscriptions](../guides/product-catalog/modifying-subscriptions.md#prorations-for-in-advance-fees).
