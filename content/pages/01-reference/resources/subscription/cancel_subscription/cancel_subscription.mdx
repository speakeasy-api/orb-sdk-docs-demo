## Cancel Subscription

This endpoint can be used to cancel an existing subscription. It returns the serialized subscription object with an
`end_date` parameter that signifies when the subscription will transition to an ended state.

The body parameter `cancel_option` determines the cancellation behavior. Orb supports three cancellation options:
- `end_of_subscription_term`: stops the subscription from auto-renewing. Subscriptions that have been cancelled with
  this option can still incur charges for the remainder of their term:
    - Issuing this cancellation request for a monthly subscription will keep the subscription active until the start
      of the subsequent month, and potentially issue an invoice for any usage charges incurred in the intervening
      period.
    - Issuing this cancellation request for a quarterly subscription will keep the subscription active until the end
      of the quarter and potentially issue an invoice for any usage charges incurred in the intervening period.
    - Issuing this cancellation request for a yearly subscription will keep the subscription active for the full
      year. For example, a yearly subscription starting on 2021-11-01 and cancelled on 2021-12-08 will remain active
      until 2022-11-01 and potentially issue charges in the intervening months for any recurring monthly usage
      charges in its plan.
    - **Note**: If a subscription's plan contains prices with difference cadences, the end of term date will be
      determined by the largest cadence value. For example, cancelling end of term for a subscription with a
      quarterly fixed fee with a monthly usage fee will result in the subscription ending at the end of the quarter.

- `immediate`: ends the subscription immediately, setting the `end_date` to the current time:
    - Subscriptions that have been cancelled with this option will be invoiced immediately. This invoice will
      include any usage fees incurred in the billing period up to the cancellation, along with any prorated
      recurring fees for the billing period, if applicable.
    - **Note**: If the subscription has a recurring fee that was paid in-advance, the prorated amount for the
      remaining time period will be added to the [customer's balance](list-balance-transactions) upon immediate
      cancellation. However, if the customer is ineligible to use the customer balance, the subscription cannot be
      cancelled immediately.

- `requested_date`: ends the subscription on a specified date, which requires a `cancellation_date` to be passed in.
  If no timezone is provided, the customer's timezone is used.  For example, a subscription starting on January 1st
  with a monthly price can be set to be cancelled on the first of any month after January 1st (e.g. March 1st, April
  1st, May 1st). A subscription with multiple prices with different cadences defines the "term" to be the highest
  cadence of the prices.

Upcoming subscriptions are only eligible for immediate cancellation, which will set the `end_date` equal to the
`start_date` upon cancellation.

## Backdated cancellations
Orb allows you to cancel a subscription in the past as long as there are no paid invoices between the
`requested_date` and the current time. If the cancellation is after the latest issued invoice, Orb will generate a
balance refund for the current period. If the cancellation is before the most recently issued invoice, Orb will void
the intervening invoice and generate a new one based on the new dates for the subscription. See the section on
[cancellation behaviors](../guides/product-catalog/creating-subscriptions.md#cancellation-behaviors).
