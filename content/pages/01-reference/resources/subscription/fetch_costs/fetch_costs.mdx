###### *Subscription*

## Fetch Costs

This endpoint is used to fetch a day-by-day snapshot of a subscription's costs in Orb, calculated by applying
pricing information to the underlying usage (see the [subscription usage endpoint](fetch-subscription-usage) to
fetch usage per metric, in usage units rather than a currency).

The semantics of this endpoint exactly mirror those of [fetching a customer's costs](fetch-customer-costs). Use this
endpoint to limit your analysis of costs to a specific subscription for the customer (e.g. to de-aggregate costs
when a customer's subscription has started and stopped on the same day).
