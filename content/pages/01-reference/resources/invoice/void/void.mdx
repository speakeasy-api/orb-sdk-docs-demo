###### *Invoice*

## Void

This endpoint allows an invoice's status to be set the `void` status. This can only be done to invoices that are in
the `issued` status.

If the associated invoice has used the customer balance to change the amount due, the customer balance operation
will be reverted. For example, if the invoice used $10 of customer balance, that amount will be added back to the
customer balance upon voiding.
