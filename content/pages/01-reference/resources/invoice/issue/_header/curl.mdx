## /invoices/{'{'}invoice_id{'}'}/issue

This endpoint allows an eligible invoice to be issued manually. This is only possible with invoices where status is `draft`,
`will_auto_issue` is true, and an `eligible_to_issue_at` is a time in the past. Issuing an invoice could possibly trigger
side effects, some of which could be customer-visible (e.g. sending emails, auto-collecting payment,
syncing the invoice to external providers, etc).
