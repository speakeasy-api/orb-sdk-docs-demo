## Create Ledger Entry External Id

This endpoint allows you to create a new ledger entry for a specified customer's balance. This can be used to
increment balance, deduct credits, and change the expiry date of existing credits.

## Effects of adding a ledger entry
1. After calling this endpoint, [Fetch Credit Balance](fetch-customer-credits) will return a credit block that
  represents the changes (i.e. balance changes or transfers).
2. A ledger entry will be added to the credits ledger for this customer, and therefore returned in the
  [View Credits Ledger](fetch-customer-credits) response as well as serialized in the response to this request. In
  the case of deductions without a specified block, multiple ledger entries may be created if the deduction spans
  credit blocks.
3. If `invoice_settings` is specified, an invoice will be created that reflects the cost of the credits (based on
  `amount` and `per_unit_cost_basis`).

## Adding credits
  Adding credits is done by creating an entry of type `increment`. This requires the caller to specify a number of
  credits as well as an optional expiry date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Orb also recommends specifying a description
  to assist with auditing. When adding credits, the caller can also specify a cost basis per-credit, to indicate
  how much in USD a customer paid for a single credit in a block. This can later be used for revenue recognition.

The following snippet illustrates a sample request body to increment credits which will expire in January of 2022.

```json
{
  "entry_type": "increment",
  "amount": 100,
  "expiry_date": "2022-12-28",
  "per_unit_cost_basis": "0.20",
  "description": "Purchased 100 credits"
}
```

Note that by default, Orb will always first increment any _negative_ balance in existing blocks before adding the
remaining amount to the desired credit block.

### Invoicing for credits
By default, Orb manipulates the credit ledger but does not charge for credits. However, if you pass
`invoice_settings` in the body of this request, Orb will also generate a one-off invoice for the customer for the
credits pre-purchase. Note that you _must_ provide the `per_unit_cost_basis`, since the total charges on the
invoice are calculated by multiplying the cost basis with the number of credit units added.

## Deducting Credits
Orb allows you to deduct credits from a customer by creating an entry of type `decrement`. Orb matches the
algorithm for automatic deductions for determining which credit blocks to decrement from. In the case that the
deduction leads to multiple ledger entries, the response from this endpoint will be the final deduction. Orb also
optionally allows specifying a description to assist with auditing.

The following snippet illustrates a sample request body to decrement credits.

```json
{
  "entry_type": "decrement",
  "amount": 20,
  "description": "Removing excess credits"
}
```

## Changing credits expiry
If you'd like to change when existing credits expire, you should create a ledger entry of type `expiration_change`.
For this entry, the required parameter `expiry_date` identifies the _originating_ block, and the required parameter
`target_expiry_date` identifies when the transferred credits should now expire. A new credit block will be created
with expiry date `target_expiry_date`, with the same cost basis data as the original credit block, if present.

Note that the balance of the block with the given `expiry_date` must be at least equal to the desired transfer
amount determined by the `amount` parameter.

The following snippet illustrates a sample request body to extend the expiration date of credits by one year:

```json
{
  "entry_type": "expiration_change",
  "amount": 10,
  "expiry_date": "2022-12-28",
  "block_id": "UiUhFWeLHPrBY4Ad",
  "target_expiry_date": "2023-12-28",
  "description": "Extending credit validity"
}
```

## Voiding credits

If you'd like to void a credit block, create a ledger entry of type `void`. For this entry, `block_id` is required
to identify the block, and `amount` indicates how many credits to void, up to the block's initial balance. Pass
in a `void_reason` of `refund` if the void is due to a refund.

## Amendment

If you'd like to undo a decrement on a credit block, create a ledger entry of type `amendment`. For this entry, `block_id`
is required to identify the block that was originally decremented from, and `amount` indicates how many credits to return
to the customer, up to the block's initial balance.
