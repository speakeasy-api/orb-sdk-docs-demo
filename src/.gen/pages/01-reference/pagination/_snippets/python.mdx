## Pagination

Some of the endpoints in this SDK support pagination. To use pagination, you make your SDK calls as usual, but the
returned response object will have a `next` method that can be called to pull down the next group of results. If the
return value of `next` is `null`, then there are no more pages to be fetched.

Here's an example of one such pagination call:


## [object Object]

```python
import orb
from orb.models import operations, shared

s = orb.Orb(
    api_key_auth="",
)


res = s.coupon.list(cursor='string', limit=768578, redemption_code='string', show_archived=False)

if res.coupons is not None:
    while True:
        # handle items

        res = res.Next()
        if res is None:
            break

```
