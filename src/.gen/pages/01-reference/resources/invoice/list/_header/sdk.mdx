## List

This endpoint returns a list of all [`Invoice`](../guides/concepts#invoice)s for an account in a list format.

The list of invoices is ordered starting from the most recently issued invoice date. The response also includes
[`pagination_metadata`](../reference/pagination), which lets the caller retrieve the next page of results if they
exist.

By default, this only returns invoices that are `issued`, `paid`, or `synced`.
