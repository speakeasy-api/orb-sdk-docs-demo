## Update Plan External

This endpoint is used to fetch [plan](../guides/concepts##plan-and-price) details given an external_plan_id identifier.
It returns information about the prices included in the plan and their configuration, as well
as the product that the plan is attached to.

## Serialized prices
Orb supports a few different pricing models out of the box. Each of these
models is serialized differently in a given [Price](../guides/concepts#plan-and-price) object.
The `model_type` field determines the key for the configuration object that is present.
A detailed explanation of price types can be found in the [Price schema](../guides/concepts#plan-and-price).
