## /events/backfills/{'{'}backfill_id{'}'}/revert

Reverting a backfill undoes all the effects of closing the backfill. If the backfill is reflected, the status will
transition to `pending_revert` while the effects of the backfill are undone. Once all effects are undone, the
backfill will transition to `reverted`.

If a backfill is reverted before its closed, no usage will be updated as a result of the backfill and it will
immediately transition to `reverted`.
