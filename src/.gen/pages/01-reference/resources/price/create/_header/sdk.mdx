## Create

This endpoint is used to create a [price](../reference/price).
A price created using this endpoint is always an add-on, meaning that itâ€™s not associated with a specific plan and can instead
be individually added to subscriptions, including subscriptions on different plans.

An `external_price_id` can be optionally specified as an alias to allow ergonomic interaction with prices in the Orb API.

See the [Price resource](../reference/price) for the specification of
different price model configurations possible in this endpoint.
